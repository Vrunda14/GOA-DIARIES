        POLITICAL HISTORY OF GOA :</h10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p10>
        The politics of Goa are a result of the uniqueness of this region due to 450 years of Portuguese rule, in comparison to three centuries of British rule experienced by the rest of India. The Indian National Congress was unable to achieve electoral success in the first two decades after the State's incorporation into India.Instead, the state was dominated by the regional political parties like Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and the United Goans Party.
